//Use ratio of (mapWidth-xcoord)/xcoord to determine how many miners to send east versus west
//Each bot could go ~5 steps in that direction strictly, unless lead deposit found. Helps spread apart and prevent clumping
//vs pathfinding directly?

//Use ratio of (mapHeight-ycoord)/ycoord to determine how many miners to send south versus north
//And send a few to near the circle around the lab -> check HP; if decreasing, send coords, pathfind, and send soldiers
